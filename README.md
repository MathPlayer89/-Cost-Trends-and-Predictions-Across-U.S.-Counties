# -Cost-Trends-and-Predictions-Across-U.S.-Counties
A data science project analyzing cost-of-living trends across U.S. counties using statistical analysis, regression modeling, and clustering.


## Project Overview
This project examines cost-of-living trends across U.S. counties using data analysis, regression modeling, and clustering. By leveraging structured cost and income data, the goal is to identify patterns, visualize trends, and build predictive models to estimate future cost shifts. Understanding how expenses evolve across regions provides valuable insights into affordability, economic planning, and financial decision-making.

## Objectives
- Perform data-driven analysis to uncover regional disparities in cost-of-living.
- Develop predictive models to estimate future cost changes based on economic indicators.
- Apply clustering techniques to group counties with similar cost structures.
- Generate visualizations that highlight expense trends across different geographic areas.

## Dataset
- Source: US Cost of Living Dataset (3171 Counties)
- Key Features:
  - Housing, food, transportation, healthcare, childcare, and tax costs
  - Metro vs. non-metro classification
  - Median family income

## Methodology
### 1. Data Preprocessing & Analysis
- Handling missing values and data cleaning
- Preparing the featyres for modeling
### 2. Regression Modeling
- Developing predictive models for cost-of-living adjustments
- Evaluating model accuracy using statistical metrics
### 3. Clustering Analysis
- Grouping counties by cost patterns
- Comparing cluster results with demographic and income factors

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels
